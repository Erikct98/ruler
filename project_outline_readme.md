# Project outline for group 4 - Rubberbanding

The stubs for our project can be found under the rubberbanding directories, under the unity directory:

/unity/Assets/RubberBanding
/unity/Assets/Scripts/RubberBanding

We divide the work into 3 main components namely:

- Convex hull related methods, and data structures.
- Range query tree (RQT) related methods, and data structures.
- General game logic, interaction, AI and UI.

Erik will be working on the RQT components. Paul will be working on the convex hull related methods, and Jurrien will work on the general game logic, AI and UI.
